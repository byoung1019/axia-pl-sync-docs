# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: June 9, 2025_

Axia P&L Sync (“we,” “us,” or “our”) is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains what information we collect, how we use it, and your rights.

## 1. Information We Collect  
- **QuickBooks Data:** With your permission, we access and process your QuickBooks Online data (e.g., account names, P&L figures).  
- **Authentication Data:** We store OAuth tokens in encrypted form to maintain secure access to your QuickBooks account.  
- **Usage Logs:** We may collect non-identifying usage metrics (e.g., timestamp of sync jobs, success/failure status).

## 2. How We Use Information  
- **Service Delivery:** To automate P&L syncing between QuickBooks and your Excel or Google Sheets master file.  
- **Improvements:** To diagnose issues and improve functionality.  
- **Notifications:** To send you job-completion alerts (via email or chat integrations), if enabled.

## 3. Data Security  
- We use industry-standard encryption (TLS/SSL) to protect data in transit.  
- OAuth tokens and any stored data are encrypted at rest.  
- Only authorized personnel (you and those you designate) can access your data.

## 4. Data Retention  
- We retain your authentication tokens and logs only as long as needed to provide the service.  
- You can revoke access or delete your data at any time by disconnecting the app.

## 5. Your Rights  
- **Access & Correction:** You may request a copy of your stored data or ask us to correct inaccuracies.  
- **Deletion:** You may request complete deletion of your data from our systems.  
- **Withdrawal of Consent:** You can revoke OAuth permissions via your QuickBooks Online app settings.

## 6. Third-Party Services  
- We do not share your personal or financial data with third parties except for the QuickBooks API, which you authorize.  
- We may use analytics providers for aggregated, non-identifying usage metrics.

## 7. Changes to This Policy  
We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of material changes via email or in-app notification.
